# Attention
- The program requires info to be stored in the .env file at the root of the project to run (alongside to ```src``` folder)
- You should create this file (.env), or remove ```.example``` from the filename of ```.env.example``` stored in the repo root
- Also, the program requires the libs ```gson``` and ```dotenv-java``` to be in the build-path. Their jars are also in the root.

# Example
Your env should look like this:
```
TOKEN=807a7a24e724e403fd7514hj
BASE_CURRENCY=BRL
```
